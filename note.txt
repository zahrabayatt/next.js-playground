for sending email we need to use a email service provider, react email integrate with various providers: https://react.email/docs/integrations/overview 

in this app we use resend as email service provider: https://resend.com

resend getting start in next.js: https://resend.com/docs/send-with-nextjs

In this demonstration, we will create an API endpoint for sending emails. However, in a real application, it is not advisable to have a dedicated endpoint solely for sending emails. Instead, email sending should be integrated into your business operations. For instance, when a user places an order, a confirmation email should be sent as part of the order submission process.
