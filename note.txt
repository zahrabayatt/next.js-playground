Authenticate Session:

When a user logs in, NextAuth creates an authentication session for that user. By default, that session is represented as a JSON Web Token.

Where can I find the session token? 

open up DevTools, go to the application tab, then open cookies, and look at our website. So here we have a cookie by this name, NextAuth Session Token. So cookies, as you probably know,
are small pieces of information that are exchanged between the
client and server with each request. So anytime our application sends a request to the server, these cookies or these pieces of
information are sent to the server. Now, here we have a cookie called session token. the value of session token looks like a long random string, but this is actually a JSON web token.

A JSON web token is like an ID card, like a passport or driver license that the client uses to identify itself. 
behind this long string, we actually have a JSON object. That JSON object is encoded using the base 64 algorithm. That is why we cannot see its content here. But the server uses NextAuth and
NextAuth knows how to decode this.

we can access to the session on the client and the server.
