Database Adapter:

So, up to this point, we can log into our application via Google.  
That's great. But in a real application, we typically need to store our users in a database. These users can have related data like pictures, posts, and so on.  
This is where we use adapters. If we use an adapter, when someone logs in, NextAuth will automatically store their data in our database.

Prisma Adapter in NextAuth: https://authjs.dev/getting-started/adapters/prisma 
**in this doc, remember to install prisma adapter from next-auth instead of auth!!!
