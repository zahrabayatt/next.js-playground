As we define or change our models, we have to create migrations.
These migrations are used to keep our database schema in sync with our Prisma schema. 

if you're using a relational database like mysql or postgres, to create a migration, run this command:
npx prisma migrate dev 

if you're using a non-sql database like mongo, to create a migration, run this command:
npx prisma db push
