To set up the React Email preview tool, run the command `npm run preview-email`. Before running it, ensure that the `.react-email/` folder is added to `.gitignore` to prevent thousands of generated files from being tracked in the Git repository. After running the command, the application will install its dependencies, which may take 10â€“20 seconds. Once installed, the preview tool will be available at `http://localhost:3030`. This tool displays all email templates from the `emails` folder and allows you to test them directly in the browser.  

The tool also supports sending test emails without needing a mail server. You can input an email address and send the email with a simple click.
