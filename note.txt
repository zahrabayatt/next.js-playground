instal prisma as ORM: npm i prisma

an ORM is like a tool that sits between our application and a database. we use this ORM to send and get data back or use it to create, update, or delete data.

install prisma vs code extension to get completion, syntax highlighting, formatting and so on.

prisma comes with command-line interface that we can work with using npx, so if we type npx prisma, we can see examples of commands that are available to us.

npx prisma init -->  Set up Prisma for your app
