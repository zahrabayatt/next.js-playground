Optimizing Image: 
We can optimize our images using the image component in next.js. This component is built on top of the standard image element in HTML, but under the hood it automatically compresses and resizes our images based on the device size, So in the next.js application we should always prefer to use this component as opposed to the standard image element in HTML.

To protect your application from malicious users, configuration is required in order to use external images. This ensures that only external images from your account can be served from the Next.js Image Optimization API. These external images can be configured with the remotePatterns property in your next.config.js file.
