        In the console, we get a warning saying an image with source has fill, but the parent element has an invalid static position. The parent must have a position of relative, absolute, or fixed. By default, the main element is static, causing this warning. To fix it, set the parentâ€™s class to relative, absolute, or fixed.

        We may also see a warning about the image having a fill but a height of zero. This happens because the parent element lacks a height. To fix this, set a height, like h-screen, for full viewport height. For cards, set an appropriate height for the parent. */}

Okay, but if you have images that should be visible right from the get-go, then we should set priority here.
