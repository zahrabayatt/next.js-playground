// What is Next.js?

// It is an incredibly powerful framework for building fast and search engine friendly applications.
// It's built on top of react. So everything you have learned about react is still relevant But next JS takes web development to the next level.
// while react is just a library for creating interactive user interfaces Next JS is a comprehensive framework. framework is a collection of libraries, tools and and conventions that streamline application development. for example Next.js includes its own routing library So we don't need to use a separate library like react router in terms of tooling.
// Next.js comes with a compiler for transforming and minifying our JavaScript code
// it also comes with a Command - line interface for building and starting our application and a node JS runtime.

//  What is Node JS runtime and why next.js comes with that?

// there are two main ways we can execute JavaScript code within a web browser on the client side or within a node JS runtime on the server So a node JS runtime is just a fancy term for a program that can execute JavaScript code So next JS comes with a node JS runtime and this allows us to do some really cool things:
// 1- with the Node JS runtime, we can do full stack development, so we can write both the front-end and back-end code within the same next.js project. the backend code executed within the node js runtime and teh front-end code gets bundled and sent to the client for execution within a web browser.
// 2- The Node JS runtime also allows us to render our components on the server and send their content to the client. This technique is called server-side rendering or SSR and can make our applications faster and more search engine friendly.

// With Next.js, we can pre-render certain pages and components that have static data when we build our application. We just render them once and serve them whenever they are needed. This technique is called static site generation and can make our applications super fast.

// In a nutshell, Next.js is a framework for building super fast and search engine-friendly applications.
